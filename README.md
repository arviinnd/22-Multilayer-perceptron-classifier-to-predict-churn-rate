Subject: use case on multi layer perceptron classifier for predicting churn rate.
<br>
<br>
We have been given a dataset of 10000 customers of a bank which has been observing unusual churning rates. Our goal is to build a machine 
learning model using artificial neural networks and predict the churning rates. We use the MLP classifier from the sklearn library. As the 
dataset is an imbalanced one, we use synthetic minority oversampling technique to account for the imbalance. The model gives an accuracy 
of 87 % with a recall value of 89 % for churning customers. We also compare the results with the random forest classifier taking 10,20,30 
and 40 trees. Random Forest classifier gives comparable accuracy overall but is not able to give high accuracy for predicting churning.
